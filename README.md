# Customer_Purchase_Behavior_Analysis

Introduction
----------------------
My team and I aim to help a medium-size cosmetics online store better understand its customers’ purchasing activity, customer value and enhance sales. To achieve the business goal, we will focus on 3 core tasks:  

1. Use classification to understand what affects purchase decision and make prediction on customer’s purchase decision 
2. Use clustering to group customers based on their value 
3. Use classification to predict customers’ next purchase day range
